                                                    THE FIRST PART 
                                                    
I am going to provide some weekly updates about The Data Structures and Algorithms.
The first content,goes as follows :)                                              
What I am Going to tell you about the Asymptotic Notations of the Algorithms ..For eg.O(n),O(n^2)..You might have read it various places,
but this is what makes sense.

First I will tell you about the Algorithms,
An Algorithm is basically a well defined steps/procedure that gives some output on some set of inputs.Eg:- to make a cup of coffee,
In computer world like Sieve of Erastosthenes,Bellmann-Ford,Dijkstra's etc..

Next Now ,when you have certain algorithms (let's take for an instance and we will learn it later) for counting the no of integers
in a number.Then to decide exactly which will be the best algorithms,the asymptotic notations are used.

Now the term "Asymptotic Notations" are the languages used to define the running time of an algorithm by analysing the input size (n) 
and the running time (t).The asymptotic notations are of 

Algorithm 1:-
